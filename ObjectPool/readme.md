# `IResettable` Interface for `ObjectPool`

The `IResettable` interface in .NET 8 is part of the `Microsoft.Extensions.ObjectPool` library. It introduces a method called `TryReset()`. This method is designed to reset an object back to its initial state. The purpose of this interface is to optimize memory usage by pooling objects that are expensive to allocate by simplifying the process of resetting reusable types back to their default state between uses, ensuring optimal performance. However, it's important to note that object pooling doesn't always improve performance and should be used only after collecting performance data using realistic scenarios for your app or library.

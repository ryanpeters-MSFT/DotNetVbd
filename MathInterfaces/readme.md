# Generic Math

Although previewed in .NET 6, .NET 7 adds full support for being able to define type constraints for number "types", similar to a constraint is used for a reference type or a struct. 

For example, in the method below, it can be invoked with any type for `T`, such as Int32, Int64, Float, Double, Decimal, etc. Previously, one would have to either create overloads for each type of `T` or apply tricky conversion using reflection to sum the values. 

```csharp
static T Add<T>(T left, T right) where T : INumber<T>
{
    return left + right;
}
```

In contrast, in order to write this in earlier versions of .NET, you would have two options, and both options suffer from poor performance. First, you can use the `dynamic` keyword to handle the addition:

```csharp
static dynamic Add(dynamic left, dynamic right)
{
    return left + right;
}
```

The second option makes use of reflection to determine the addition operator on the type and invoke the operation:

```csharp
static T Add<T>(T left, T right)
{
    // Get the addition operator for the type
    var method = typeof(T)
        .GetMethods(BindingFlags.Static | BindingFlags.NonPublic)
        .FirstOrDefault(m => m.Name.Contains("op_Addition"));
    
    return (T)method.Invoke(null, new object[] { left, right });
}
```

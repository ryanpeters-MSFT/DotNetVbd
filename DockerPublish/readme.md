# Publish Container Image using `dotnet publish` (.NET 7)

Publishing a Docker image from a .NET application in .NET 7 is streamlined with the `dotnet publish` command. This process eliminates the need for a Dockerfile and allows developers to containerize their .NET applications directly. If you are running .NET 7 SDK, you must include the `Microsoft.NET.Build.Containers` NuGet package to your project. As of .NET 8, these package APIs are part of the core SDK. Once added, you can configure the Docker image properties within the `.csproj` file, such as setting the image name and tag using the `ContainerImageName` and `ContainerImageTag` properties. Finally, you publish the image to your local Docker daemon with the `dotnet publish` command, specifying the target OS and architecture. This command builds the application and packages it into a Docker image, ready for deployment.

## Benefits

Using `dotnet publish` for containers in .NET 7 offers several benefits over traditional Docker:

1. **Simplicity**: The `dotnet publish` command simplifies the process of creating Docker images. It eliminates the need for an additional DockerfileÂ², reducing the amount of Docker code that developers have to maintain.

2. **Inference**: The tools used by `dotnet publish` can infer intent and make decisions on your behalf, such as choosing the best base image to use.

3. **Integration with .NET SDK**: Starting with .NET SDK version 8.0.200, the PublishContainer target is available for every project. This means you can avoid depending on the Microsoft.NET.Build.Containers NuGet package.

4. **Container Features**: Containers created using `dotnet publish` have many features and benefits, such as being an immutable infrastructure, providing a portable architecture, and enabling scalability. The image can be used to create containers for your local development environment, private cloud, or public cloud.

It's important to note that Dockerfiles remain very popular and continue to provide extensive samples. They are often used when prototyping ideas or reproducing a customer issue. Also, Docker has an advantage when it comes to layer caching. If two Docker images use the same "base" image, Docker will naturally "de-dupe" the duplicate layers.

While `dotnet publish` offers several benefits, the choice between it and Docker may depend on your specific needs and familiarity with the tools. Both have their strengths and can be used effectively to containerize .NET applications.

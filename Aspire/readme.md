# .NET Aspire (.NET 8)

**.NET Aspire** is an opinionated stack specifically crafted for building **resilient, observable, and configurable cloud-native applications** using **.NET**. It aims to address the complexities developers face when building cloud apps, allowing them to focus more on their business logic and less on cloud intricacies. By providing a curated set of components enhanced for cloud-native scenarios, .NET Aspire streamlines the development process.

## Key Features and Components

The stack includes several essential components:

1. **Service Discovery** - .NET Aspire incorporates built-in service discovery capabilities. Developers can easily configure and interconnect different parts of their distributed applications without delving into low-level implementation details.

2. **Telemetry and Observability** - The stack enhances observability by handling telemetry, health checks, and environment variables. This ensures that developers can monitor their applications effectively.

3. **Resilience** - .NET Aspire promotes resilience by incorporating features like circuit breakers, retries, and timeouts. These mechanisms help applications gracefully handle failures and recover.

4. **Local Developer Experience** - Developers can enjoy a sophisticated yet straightforward local development experience. .NET Aspire simplifies the discovery, acquisition, and configuration of essential dependencies for cloud-native apps.

## Use Cases and Benefits

1. **Cloud-Native Applications** - .NET Aspire is tailor-made for cloud-native scenarios. It empowers developers to build applications that seamlessly scale, adapt to dynamic environments, and take advantage of cloud services.

2. **Microservices Architecture** - When developing microservices-based systems, .NET Aspire provides the necessary tools for service discovery, resilience, and observability. It ensures smooth communication between microservices.

3. **Containerized Applications** - With .NET Aspire, creating containerized applications becomes straightforward. The stack integrates well with container technologies, making it easy to package and deploy .NET apps in containers.

4. **Highly Available Systems** - By handling health checks and promoting resilience, .NET Aspire contributes to building highly available systems. It ensures that applications remain operational even during failures or disruptions.

## Availability

The first preview of .NET Aspire ships with **.NET 8** and will be part of the official release in spring next year. Developers can explore the .NET Aspire Starter template, experiment with its features, and leverage its opinionated approach to cloud-native development.

In summary, .NET Aspire simplifies the cloud-native journey for .NET developers, allowing them to focus on creating robust, scalable, and efficient applications without getting bogged down by cloud complexities.
